# CSESoc-Hackathon-2021
Winner of the CSESoc 2021 Annual Flagship Hackathon

**Problem Statement:**
There have been many challenges in making education equitable across the world. Education is inaccessible and less of a priority for many, especially those living with disabilities, coming from a low socioeconomic status, or living in a rural setting. These challenges call for an emphasis on education beyonf formulised settings, a redefinition of the current institutionalised practices, the formulation of inclusive pathways, and more.

Technology is a great way to address these needs. Some focus of your solution might be:
- Accessiblity of knowledge
- Effectiveness of education
- Development of skills beyong the classroom

**Solution:**
Kube, a video viewing platform and analytics dashboard that gives students the opportunity to flag sections for review and make comments on a lecturer's recording. The lecture has access to a wide range of analytics, including:
- A graphical representation of student flags, so they can identify which sections of the lecture students had the most difficulty with
- Comments from students when they flagged timestamps
- A graphical representation of drop off points, allowing lecturers to see when students leave their lectures
- Analytics on sections of the video which students replayed, suggesting that students may have difficulty grasping that concept
- The option to send these analytics reports to their emails or mobile number regularly via Twilio SendGrid

**Tech Stack:**
ReactJS, Meteor Framework, MongoDB
